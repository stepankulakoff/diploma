Russian historians are well represented by Oleg Airapetov, Poslednyaya Voyna Imperatorskoy Rossii (Moscow, 2002) and Generaly, Liberaly i Predprinimately (Moscow, 2003) which acutely examines the divisions at the top in Russia before the Revolution. Chapter 6: J. W. Wheeler Bennett, Brest-Litovsk: The Forgotten Peace (London, 1938) is the book, but W. Baumgart, Deutsche Ostpolitik 1918 (Vienna, 1966) has important details regarding the Caucasus, Ukraine, etc. The Ludendorff offensives are discussed in Martin Middlebrook, The Kaiser’s Battle (London, 1978) and Tim Travers, How the War was Won (London, 1992); for the decline of the German war economy, see G. D. Feldman, Army, Industry and Labour in Germany 1914–1918 (Princeton, 1966). Klaus Schwabe, Woodrow Wilson, Revolutionary Germany and Peacemaking 1918–1919 (London, 1985) ends the war. Bernard Michel, La Chute de l’Empire austro-hongrois (Paris, 1991) recounts the disintegration of Central Europe in absorbing detail. Chapter 7: see Stanford J. Shaw, From Empire to Republic: The Turkish War of National Liberation 1918–1923 (5 vols., Türk Tarih Kurumu, 2000) and Michael Llewellyn-Smith, Ionian Vision (Michigan, 1999) which is extraordinarily fair-minded as between Greeks and Turks. Margaret MacMillan, Paris 1919 (New York, 2003) is a splendid survey of peacemaking, and Robert Skidelsky, J. M. Keynes: Hopes Betrayed (London, 1998) is a brilliant book on the intellectual and moral atmosphere of that generation. For the Middle East, David Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace (London, 2005) has been deservedly a bestseller, but there are two older books that make for thought:Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism (New York, 2003) and Elie Kedourie, England and the Middle East: The Destruction of the Ottoman Empire. For the upshot in Germany, Samuel Halperin, Germany Tried Democracy (rep. New York, 1965) is a journalist’s very well informed account, though it should be read together with H. A.
